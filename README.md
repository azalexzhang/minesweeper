# My Personal Project: Recreating Minesweeper in Java

## Alex Zhang

**Overview**  
This project intends to re-create the classic Minesweeper game. The object of the game is to clear a board
with individual squares, without hitting a square containing a mine. Each individual square will contain an
integer from 1 to 8 to give a hint of how many mines there are in adjacent squares. The scoring system that
will be implemented will simply be the time taken to beat the game in seconds, therefore meaning that a
lower score is better.

**Who will use it?**  
It can be used by pretty much anyone, including other CPSC 210 students who just need a break from their
Java projects as well. :)

**Why is this project of interest to me?**  
I used to often play this game during the Windows 7 years, when Minesweeper came preinstalled (although I
wasn't very good), and figured that it would be fairly easy to implement in Java.

**User Stories**  
- As a user, I want to be able to choose a difficulty level.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a square and clear it.
- As a user, I want to be able to "flag" a square I believe holds a mine.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my score to a leaderboard.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the leaderboard.
- As a user, I want to be able to erase all data from the leaderboard.
